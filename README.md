[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/event.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/event)

Small python module that implements the observer pattern via a decorator.


## Description

This is based on a [thread on stackoverflow]
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1904351/python-observer-pattern-examples-tips)
(the example of C#-like events by Jason
Orendorff), so I don't take any credit for the
idea. I merely made a fancy module with documentation and tests out of it,
since I needed it in a bigger project. It is quite handy and I've been using
it in a couple of projects, which require some sort of event handling.

Thus it is [licensed as CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
so basically do-whatever-you-want to the extent legally possible.


## Continuous integration

For the fun of it, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/aepsil0n/event) is used
for continuous integration.


## Credits

Thanks to Jason Orendorff on for the idea on stackoverflow. I also want to
thank @coldfix and @Moredread for contributions and feedback.
